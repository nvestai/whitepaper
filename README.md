Revolutionary Crypto Data & Analytics Platform
April 28, 2018, White Paper version 1.0
Abstract — As the evolution of cryptocurrencies progresses, the velocity, variety and volume of data makes it difficult for traders and investors to keep up with all the news & developments. This is exemplified with the recent explosion of new project launches (ICO’s) be-ginning in 2017, in addition to the important advances amongst well-established projects. 
    There is simply too much data for the human brain to process. Yet successful investing often requires one to analyze large amounts of data from a variety of sources to be able to find the signal from the noise and spot trends before the crowd. Therefore, investors who can harness insights from data will be one step ahead.
    Recent advances in AI and Machine Learning are perfectly suited for decision making tasks made on large, complex data sets and can provide unparalleled insights beyond simple human abilities. However such sophisticated technologies require both technical and domain expertise to fully leverage their application to crypto markets. 
   Nvest empowers all users, regardless of their technical background, to make better investment decisions by providing accessible AI tools and enabling technology applications. The nvest technology platform will host proprietary tools/applications (apps) created by the nvest team and designated token rewards will incentivize community members to create and share new tools and content. The nvest platform combines professionally curated data, plug-and-play AI algorithms and interactive visualization tools into a full suite. 
    As a community, nvest creates a symbiotic relationship between technologists (data/computer scientists) and investors/traders. The nvest platform provides investors and traders a wide ranging technology solution and for developers, nvest streamlines application devel-opment. By focusing on content/tool users and creators, strong network effects will accrue to the nvest platform and benefit all users. 
Compared to other companies we think that: Bloomberg + Facebook + Tableau = nvest.ai

Mission Statement— Create a revolutionary crypto data and analytics platform by combining accessible AI technologies with incentivized community participation. Nvest.ai – Complexity Simplified Elegantly

1	INTRODUCTION 
TECHNOLGY  is changing every industry. Complex tasks like investing and trading are easily performed by machines when they have the appropriate data and instructions. While some academics assume markets are perfectly efficient and all data and information is reflected in market prices, in the real-world traders and investors know that’s almost never the case. In a world awash with data and where Machine Learning is in-creasingly being adopted, nvest provides a technology solution for traders and investors, by providing them the tools they need to make better decisions. The follow-ing principles guide the nvest project: 
1.	In today’s crypto markets, users who adopt a technolo-gy strategy to capture insights from data and harness sophisticated machine learning algorithms have an edge over users who do not have any technology strategy. 
2.	All users should have access to powerful algorithms, regardless of their technical background.
3.	Providing preprocessed data and easy to use tools em-powers users to focus their time and energy on tasks where they can add more value.  
4.	Beautiful and interactive visualizations are essiential to provide a clear window into the otherwise complex data and number-crunching results.    
5.	A community can use a token to provide an incentive mechanism for users with different backgrounds to cre-ate, collaborate and share their expertise.
6.	The value of an investment community is increased when users of different backgrounds interact and con-tribute. This creates positive network effects for current and prospective users 
7.	The initial overhead involved in data collection, pro-cessing and algorithmic development is often large and fraught with many unexpected details that require thoughtful domain expertise, yet it is essiential for all Machine Learning tasks. Amortizing this cost over many users is an efficient solution.

2 PLATFORM
In order to harness insights from data, the nvest plat-form is built upon the following technology pillars: Da-ta,     Algorithms & Visualization: 
Data:  Nvest will collect, process and provide users with professional quality raw data. The foundation of all da-ta analytics rests on quality data, as the saying, garbage-in-garbage-out, illustrates. As analytical capabilities ex-tend from relatively constrained structured data to big data, unstructured data and real-time streaming, ensur-ing professional level data integrity is increasingly a major concern. Recent studies suggest that around 60-80% of a data scientist’s time is spent collecting, review-ing and cleaning datasets.1 In addition to technical competence, data integrity must be coupled with do-main expertise to ensure that curated data is useful and appropriate for AI and algorithmic processing. 
A sample of the data nvest will collect, includes:

□    Crypto exchange data, including prices and order book in-formation collected at a high frequency from global exchanges.
□ Unstructured data, like text data found on websites, forums, blogs, event registries, reddit, white papers or GitHub repos. 
□ Historical and current streaming data from sites like Twitter,   Telegram, Weibo (微博), WeChat etc.

Nvest will not only create meta data for all existing and planned crypto projects, such as project name, short description, project launch date, project summary statis-tics, founder names, exchange volumes etc. but we will also create proprietary data sets, like white paper revi-sions, GitHub tracking statistics and more importantly Github scoring statistics. Domain expertise is essential to exploring and creating new data sets. 
   Most of the data will be collected and cleaned by the nvest platform, but we will partner with existing data organizations to provide part of the data services when it is the most effective route. Our goal is to provide users with a single point access to a large variety of datasets that have already been reviewed for integrity and are available for use in applications and/or data analysis. Data will be available for users to explore via an easy to use dashboard interface and an API for developers. 

Algorithms: While Machine Learning and AI accessibil-ity has greatly improved in recent years, to properly harness it’s power, one needs to be able to write code, ensure input data is properly formatted, remove any errors or biases, select an appropriate model algorithm and then tune the many model parameters which often requires complex mathematical understanding. Nvest’s team of machine learning experts will build plug-and-play intuitive and easy to use tools that removes these barriers.  Nvest empowers all users with the ability to explore machine learning models without any software programming required! Advanced users will be able to easily change settings and customize to their own needs. 
   For developers and data scientists, nvest will promote a best in class developer API which will grant them ac-cess to model level specifications. 
 
Visualization: AI and Machine Learning algorithms often produce complex results. Given a human’s lim-ited ability to store and interpret large amounts of data, visualization is often relied upon to improve interpreta-bility. With the improvement of web 2.0 tools like D3.js, interactive visualization adds another dimension to the nvest experience and allows for interpretation of more complex information.  
    Visualization is a core attribute of nvest and we will provide a variety of static and interactive charts and figures for users to explore, save and share. Developers will be able to access our open source libraries of visual-izations and easily deploy them into their applications.



2 Applications/Tools
Applications: Nvest’s technology platform hosts all ap-plication/tool development along with the user experi-ence. By creating a modern, flexible platform, nvest’s technology stack streamlines new application devel-opment, enabling fast launch, testing and analytic re-view of third party apps. In this way, the value of nvest is not tied to one or two ‘killer apps’, which may go out of fashion, but rather a marketplace of different applica-tions, created by the nvest team and a community of users. 
   A sample of nvest applications (apps) is included be-low. For more information see Appendix 3:

□ Pattern Finder: Explore the current price movement of a cryp-to currency (or any financial market instrument) and compare it with historical data. Scan for technical analysis price patterns, obtain probability estimates for trades like win/loss ratios, profit targets, d optimal holding period, maximum loss estimates, and much more. You can use Pattern finder to set price alerts and even generate your own automated trading strategy using Pattern Finder as a template with no coding requited. Don’t guess what will happen, be prepared for tomorrow by using history as a guide. 
□    Bot Builder: With simple drag-and-drop functionality, create your own algorithmic tools on an array of data, including prices, events and text processing. Design a trading strategy to execute trades based on prices or technical indicators, create custom alerts based on text data or sentiment scores, or use events like ICO funding windows as an input for your bot. Build your own bot from scratch or use existing templates to start. 
□    Token Discovery: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance your fundamental research by summarizing white papers or other text documents like blog/forum posts, create cus-tom sentiment scores, view semantic relationships and many oth-er NLP related tasks. Use nvest’s pre-built models and easily change settings to customize to your specific needs. Analyze more data than you could ever read and discover new insights. 
□    Crypto Sight: Use statistics to analyze, filter, and screen structured data across the entire crypto market. Determine what are the current macro and industry trends and create your own customized reports.   As well, monitor token hash rates, wallet creations and other blockchain data. 
□    Portfolio-Rizer: Summarize all your crypto holdings and wallets in one place and provide portfolio level calculations and recommendations. Leverage advanced quantitative finance meth-ods to calculate common risk and performance metrics. 
□    Opinionator: Buy/sell or request expert information and reports. Read a cryptographer’s review, ask an industry veteran for their thoughts or visit the marketplace to view all reports available. Opinionator allows users to monetize their knowledge via content distribution to the entire nvest user base.
 
User experience: Nvest’s platform is embedded with machine learning technology to improve the user expe-rience, including automated content recommendations, customized visual preferences, suggestions for users to follow, tools of interest, tutorials and alerts. Users can easily update and customize settings or disable all user tracking if they want to remain anonymous.  
  Nvest provides a completely flexible and customized user experience. Users can choose the tools they want to use, the data they want to analyze and even the com-munity members they wish to follow and engage with. The nvest community caters to both traders and inves-tors, from neophytes to experts and provides each with the tools and support to match their specific needs. 

3 TARGET MARKET
The initial target market for nvest, which we refer to as ‘consumers’ are professional crypto investors and trad-ers. While there are many amateur or occasional crypto investors and traders, with roughly 500,000 unique bitcoin addresses and 22 million wallets on Block-chain2, nvest will target only the top 10% of users, spe-cifically those who are active with their portfolio and/or have a sizeable amount invested. If we use the number of Bitcoin address with greater than 1 BTC as a proxy, our current market is about 700,000 users. 3 This group has the most incentive to our AI tools. By targeting pro-fessionals and more active participants initially, we are deliberately focusing on a smaller audience than what is the potential for nvest, and this is a strategic tactic. Peter Theil and Elon Musk used a similar strategy when they started PayPal, targeting large sellers on Ebay and in his recent book, Peter Theil explained why. 4

    “The perfect target market for a start-up is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets.”

Given the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies and the dif-ficulty involved in creating complex machine learning tools that are accessible and easy to use, we see the need for professional investing tools to be very high and cur-rent solutions below potential or unmet. 


Target Market #2: Creators
A key differentiator of the nvest platform is the strategic targeting of ‘creators’, who will enrich the community by creating and adding tools to the platform. While the consumers and creators are not necessarily mutually ex-clusive, as there are increasing numbers of traders who are comfortable writing code, nvest will create content and user environments specifically targeted to software developers and data scientists. We will cater to develop-ers specific needs and simplify the process involved in building and deploying new applications on the nvest platform. 
  The most popular and accessible data science pro-gramming languages today are Python and R, both of which have millions of users, though exact figures are surprisingly unavailable. Of the 18M users on Stack Overflow, Python is the fastest growing programming language, and comprises nearly 9% of all posts.5.  Nvest will ensure both Python and R are well supported by creating libraries and packages for both. Software de-velopers who don’t use Python or R will also be sup-ported with access to a REST API available in all com-mon programming languages. In addtion, developers who are skilled at creating visualizations and easy to use UX interfaces will be targeted and we will ensure they have the necessary support.

4 NETWORK EFFECTS
Financial markets by design are competitive, encourage secrecy and are often dominated by large players with limited incentives to share. Nvest breaks this paradigm by bringing together a diverse user base with different skill sets and encourages users to create, share and learn within a community by focusing on incentives. As nvest creates and hosts an increasing number of value added tools, investors and traders will be drawn to our platform in order to access them. And when that hap-pens there will be more incentive for outside developers to add new tools because of the large audience they can reach. 
    By creating a community of investors and technolo-gists, we can foster user content creation which increas-es the value add of the nvest platform and creates strong network effects. Unlike free networks, which can often be inundated with low quality content, nvest utility to-kens enable market economic forces to ensure high quality contributions are rewarded and are easily spot-ted. For example, you can easily filter high quality re-search by examining the number of subscribers a given user has and the associated cost to access their service. 
 
5 MARKET SIZE, STRUCTURE & COMPETITION 
Financial markets facilitate the movement of money between investors and firms and are key to the modern economy. Exchanges, like the New York Stock Ex-change, NASDAQ and CME allow investors and traders to easily transact, similar in the crypto world to Coin-Base, Bittrex, Binance and many others. While exchang-es provide a valuable service, the complexity of modern financial markets has necessitated information service providers as well, for example the well-known firm Bloomberg. 
  A single Bloomberg terminal is licensed at roughly $25,000 USD per annum and is considered a necessity for most institutional investors. Including the financial service divisions of close competitors Thompson Reu-ters and FactSet, the annual revenue of these three firms alone, we estimate, was over $15 Billion (B) in 2017. For comparison, the world’s 10 largest listed stock and de-rivative exchanges generated $21B in revenue in 2017 and have a combined market cap of over $255B. 6 
   Professional investors pay a high price to access ser-vices like Bloomberg because of the depth and breadth of its data and tools. While there are many other soft-ware providers, some providing niche services or others at a lower price point, the scale of the three largest firms enables them to offer the broadest array of data and ana-lytics which is tough to compete against.  
   We believe the tremendous growth in both established and new projects in the crypto markets indicates that there is a need for professional investor tools in this market as well. While many recently launched projects aim to serve this market, none so far that we can identi-fy provides the depth of nvest’s functionality or plat-form advantages. A brief summary of the competitive environment can be found in Table 1.

6  TOKEN ECONOMICS: 
Access to tools/apps running on the nvest platform will require payment using nvest tokens.  The price set to access tools will vary but the initial goal is to build a large user base so prices will be set at affordable levels. Master Holders, (see TOKEN DESCRIPTION) will de-cide on the specific pricing policies for tools. 
   Token payments received for using the platform will be property of the nvest organization (See ORGANIZA-TION). The nvest organization will distribute all tokens received according to guidelines which again will be determined by the Master Holders. Tokens generated from applications or tools built by the nvest team will initially be distributed according to the following guide-lines (after any applicable taxes/charges, and subject to review by the Master Holders) 

    Nvest Token Distribution Policy 
Percent	Distribution Party
30%	Tokens deposited into a reward pool for technolo-gists and tool creators. Distribution guidelines for reward pool will be objectively based on usage statistics and transparently displayed.
70%	Tokens held by nvest Organization and used for general budget. 

When the nvest platform is open to applications built by the community, the organization will ensure that at least 60% of the tokens received from those apps go back to the contributor for his/her hard work. The exact split will however depend on a variety of factors, including technology workload placed on nvest’s platform and improvements vs existing solutions. Master Holders will decide the specific token reward terms.  
   Once the token generation event is complete, Master Holders will be given the opportunity to vote on a varie-ty of smart contracts that will be created which will con-tain the exact details of the distribution policy. 
   Master Holders will also be allowed to vote on burn-ing part of the nvest tokens, subject to a legal opinion which can assure that nvest tokens will remain exempt under applicable federal securities laws. 
   The theoretical value of the nvest token should be linked with the utility gained from using nvest apps. If an application can save or make a user profits, then the token value should reflect a part of that. 
    Making successful investment decisions is more than just making a trade recommendation to buy or sell - it can be providing investors with portfolio management tools, informative personalized alerts, or enhancing re-search through Natural Language Processing. A key point here is that nvest apps do not need to have a direct profit and loss attributable, like a trading strategy, in order to provide value. Should the number and quality of applications built on top of the nvest platform in-crease, it is likely to provide more users with value therefore the value of the token should see commensu-rate growth. However any growth of the platform is based on a number of factors and nvest makes no claim that any future growth will be achieved. See Terms and Conditions for more details. 
       For more details regarding nvest tokens, please see Token Description. 

7  STRATEGY 
As a start-up focused on growing its user base in the rapidly evolving crypto industry, nvest will rely on lean startup methodology towards technology and product development. As nvest’s products are digital services, concepts like MVP, continuous deployment, actionable metrics, user feedback, failing fast, and strategy pivoting will be emphasized. 
   The team at nvest is committed to providing high quality results in every aspect including design, user experience, data collection, algorithmic implementation and we will embed this in our culture and values. 
   We fully expect competitor projects to copy our ideas; therefore, building a strong user base of both traders and developers is critical to our success. As an early mover delivering accessible AI tools to investors, we will move fast, delight our users and focus on creating a powerful network effect. 

8 TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING 
The technology platform is developed with the follow-ing tenets in mind: scalability in the types and size of data, scalability in processing and computation, intui-tive data models, collaboration and quick experimenta-tion and concrete metrics for success. With these, our goals are to provide a state-of-the-art platform with complete coverage of all relevant data sets necessary for market analysis - cleansed and intuitively modeled. The system is modular with plug-and-play components for quickly extending the feature set. The underlying tech-nology stack consists of the following 5 layers (see ap-pendix 1): 

1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing: This layer con-sists of statefull processes that mine, collect and prepro-cess data from external sources. The processes are run on a distributed cluster to preprocess and cleanse raw data feeds and crawler results, storing the raw data files on an HDFS data lake.
2. Data storage, Modeling and Representation: The output from the ingestion layer is then abstracted and stored in an accessible form, optimized for running que-ries efficiently. The databases will consist of distributed mongoDB instances for hierarchical data as well as Amazon Redshift clusters. Kinesis messaging stream will be used to subscribe changes to the data and post-processing will run on an EMR cluster with Spark.   
3. AI/Machine Leaning Experimentation and Model-ing: Deep learning models are developed and trained over the data abstraction layer (above) to provide predic-tive and generative features that cross the market data, personalized user preferences and other external sources. For knowledge extraction, modern NLP models will be applied to process language based inputs, lever-aging Part of Speech Tagging and training domain spe-cific word-embedding models for classification of terms and topics. These models, in combination with the deep learning architecture over structured market data, will be used for aggregating relevant and trending crypto and market “concepts” for prediction and analysis.
4. Predictive and Generative Models: Models trained will be applied to their use-cases to provide insights about cryptocurrencies. These models will process thousands of features to detect patterns and knowledge from the base data sets. These results will be further ex-posed via APIs and allow for integration with data sci-entists, business partners and app developers.  
5. Collaborative UI and Interactive Visualizations:  output from predictive analytics and generative models are interfaced with rich and customizable UI compo-nents, leveraging visualization projects such as D3.js and Tableau. Open source libraries will be created to enable developers to easily access previously deployed visualizations with limited work. Users can share, fol-low or contribute to the results. 
   In addition to the base technology platform, nvest also provides proprietary and highly optimized models that uniquely set it apart from potential competitors. In par-ticular, nvest takes a novel multi-dimensional signal processing technique to both training models as well as exposing APIs to developers. An example of a proprie-tary algorithm is our optimized wavelet feature space (Appendix 2), in combination with RNNs, which pro-vides a rich vector space representation for analysis and search of trends/patterns over arbitrary scales and times. Our basis functions have been finely tuned to provide better time-variant causal processing across data sets with high dimensional feature spaces.  
   The nvest platform is accessible via web and mobile apps using reactive design principals. Modern cross-platform JavaScript framework is used to quickly devel-op the front-end apps and admin consoles.  Front end UI layers are optimized to deal with large amounts of data, and when applicable proprietary JavaScript pro-cessing is used to reduce server workloads.     
   Technology security is maintained using industry best practices for all access points, vulnerabilities and sys-tem designs. All external traffic will flow through SSL layers. Audit trails of all transactions will be recorded, and OS/system patches will be updated on a regular basis. Regular security reviews will take place by third party security consultants. PII will be isolated in a sepa-rate data layer. 

9  SCHEDULE AND ROADMAP
DISCLAIMER: Information provided is not a commit-ment, promise or legal obligation to deliver any func-tionality. All forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Please see Terms & Conditions for more information.
 
The nvest platform is currently running live on stock market and limited crypto market data at www.nvest.io. Upon completion of the token distribution, we will merge nvest.io with nvest.ai. 
  It is important to note that nvest is building a software platform focused on data and analytics. We utilize the blockchain primarily for ownership, governanace and payments. Inasmuch our technology development is much more flexible than a blockchain foused project. We are not building a mainnet or testnet but will leverage other projects who have built that technology.

10 MARKETING 
As nvest is a startup technology platform, the company has been focused on core development needed to bring the project into operation. However many technology companies fall into the trap of ‘if you build it, they will come’ and do not succeed no matter how advanced the end product. We fully understand this and we will de-vote substantial resources to user acquisition, product marketing and design functions once the project is funded. Nvest’s public launch is an important product marketing opportunity given that initial investors will likely overlap with the target consumer user base.     
   Examples of marketing and promotional activities to drive user growth and product-adoption will include:
□ Active blogging, social media posting and promotion of user generated content on nvest and popular crypto sites. 
□ Contacting fund managers, traders, widely followed crypto investors/influencers for expert reviews and in-put towards new tools they would like to have. 
□ Contact partners in Trading, FinTech and Data Sci-ence
□ SEO, including landing pages & keyword campaigns
□ Online advertising 
□ Industry networking
□ Sponsoring & attending user groups and meetups 

Strategic Partners
Nvest is interested in partnering with strategic firms that would benefit from our tools, such as hedge funds, exchanges (to offer nvest to their users) and influencers. We are interested in making pre-sale offers to potential partners. (See TOKEN DESCRIPTION – PRE SALES for more information.)

11  TOKEN DESCRIPTION
Nvest will create 2,000,000,000 Ethereum ERC20 tokens to be held by the nvest organization and distributed to holders during the token generation event. Nvest tokens will serve as a utility token, do not pay any interest or dividends and should not be considered a security for investment purposes. Please see Legal & Regulatory for more information. Holders of 1,000,000 or more nvest tokens will confer voting rights proportional to their ownership and will be considered, “Master Holders.” 

Token Distribution
Tokens	Pct	Holders
800mm	40%	Nvest.ai (Founders and Employ-ees)
100mm	5%	Advisors & Partnerships
100mm	5%	Reward Pool initial contribution
1,000mm	50%	Public token holders
2,000mm	100%	Total 

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): Nvest intends on creating a democratic decentralized organization that exists solely in the blockchain. The DAO will be responsible for voting on all matters relat-ed to nvest tokens. In order to be a participant in the DAO, a token holder must meet the minimum threshold to be a master holder, currently set at 1,000,000 tokens, or 0.05%. The initial smart contract created with the to-ken offering will grant Master Holders the right to vote on an additional smart contract which will contain all the rules regarding Master Holder voting.  
Master Holders will be granted voting rights to make decisions on all matters related to nvest tokens, includ-ing reward pool distribution policies, app pricing and all blockchain related issues. In addition, master hold-ers may receive discount pricing and first access to all nvest apps and tools. 
Fund Raising: General sales will be open to the public beginning on June 22, 2018 through June 28, 2018, sub-ject to change. Nvest's initial token distribution will be denominated solely in Ether, and tokens will be issued at a nominal value of $0.02 USD. A minimum sale tar-get will be set at $6 Million USD/0.3 Billion tokens, which if not received by the conclusion of the distribu-tion event will result in the cancellation of the campaign and all funds will be returned. A token maximum capi-tal raise will be set at $20M. If the token minimum is met but not the token maximum then any remaining tokens will be burned along with a portion of the team and advisor tokens to ensure the stated distribution re-mains. 

A maximum of 80,000,000 tokens (4%) will be available for any individual address and a minimum deposit of 0.01 Ethereum will be required to participate. The ex-change rate, token contract address and detailed terms will be published on the nvest website 48 hours before the distribution. The exchange rate per ETH will be up-dated daily via an oracle. 
Full details of nvest’s token will be described with the release of nvest’s smart contract which will take place at least 4 weeks before any public generation event for re-view and comments. 
Private and Pre-Sales: Prior to the public sales, select private-sales will be offered to strategic partners, advi-sors and large investors for a total of $0.2M USD. Nvest will also accept pre-sales, in the amount of $3M USD, which will be governed by the smart contract but receive a sliding bonus from 20-30%8. 
For more information please contact, avi@nvest.io
Vesting: All team members, advisors and strategic partners will be subject to vesting terms which prohibit selling any token for 12 months following the token cre-ation. 
Reward Pool: All tokens designated to the reward pool will be locked and inaccessible until a follow on smart contract is created which will detail how the reward pool tokens will be distributed. Only Master Holders will be allowed to vote regarding the reward pool distri-bution policies.

Appendix 3 

Nvest Tool Explained  -- www.nvest.ai/tools.html
Intro: Nvest’s technology platform allows applications (apps) or tools to be easily built and deployed. Nvest provides the data, algorithmic models and visualization libraries to streamline software development. This means is that the initial tools or apps listed are just a sample of what will be offered in the future. There will be more apps as the developer community grows and builds their own apps.
   To kick start the platform, the team at nvest will create several applications targeted to crypto traders and in-vestors. We will get feedback from our users and pivot when necessary. The site nvest.io has a working version of Pattern Finder and Strategy Builder (a pre-curoser to the Bot Builder) for users to test and explore. Users should take note that these tools are a first version re-leases used to demonstrate the product. New version updates will commence shortly after the token genera-tion event and should dramatically improve the user experience and output results.
   A core thread running through all nvest applications is that they are easy to use and interpret. As nvest ob-tains more user data, applications will become smarter and be able to learn user preferences and provide better recommendations for user specific needs. And when the nvest UI dashboard is deployed, all nvest tools will be easily accessible for viewing and analysis.
Pattern Finder
Pattern Finder is nvest’s lead tool and is specifically built to analyze time series data, like prices, volume, sentiment, etc, to find patterns in the data automatically. It can scan for all sorts of commonly used technical analysis patterns, like candle stick formations, trends, price patterns, breakouts, consolidations etc. Patter Finder can return many different data points, like future price probability estimates, win/loss ratios, profit tar-gets, maximum loss estimates, display best fit indicators to use and much more. Armed with Pattern Finder data, traders can better analyze a trade setup, game plan for possible outcomes, or even use Pattern Finder to gener-ate a template for an automated trading bot, with no coding required.
   In order to use Pattern Finder a user must specify an instrument (crypto, stock, FX etc), a timeframe window, for example if you are looking at a chart, what is the start and end date of the chart and an analysis horizon, or how far back in the past should nvest search for pat-terns -- collectively termed a ‘trade setup’. Once a user has entered a trade setup, nvest’s algorithms searches for similar patterns across a wide body of data and pro-vides users with the different data outputs. The current version of Pattern Finder hosted on nvest.io displays the top historical price patterns that match the trade setup, along with forward walk probability distribution of those matches. In addition, individual pattern matches are available for the user to analyze.
However there is much more Pattern Finder can do. Say a user has a chart pattern they want to find, like a very specific flag formation arising after a strong trend, Pat-tern Finder can be used to scan across all crypto markets (and timeframes) to find that pattern. Similarly, one can run Pattern Finder on the entire crypto market data and request to only receive a reports/notifications when it has found a pattern with abnormal expected profits or another field which is returned from the Pattern Finder analysis.
   Pattern Finder uses advanced signal processing tech-niques, like wavelets and multidimensional feature rep-resentations to enable almost any type of data to be mined. Unlike traditional backtesting, where a user searches the historical data for a clearly defined rules/logic (if the 50 day moving average crosses below the 20 day moving average, then show me what a buy and hold strategy did etc) to retrieve statistics, Pattern Finder does not rely on any input logic from the user. Instead one can think of Pattern Finder using heuristics or what is sometimes called ‘fuzzy logic’ to determine the rules automatically. 
Voodoo or Science
A common critique of technical analysis is that its rules are mainly subjective and that if you show the same chart to several technical analysts they will often give you different interpretations. Nvest approaches tech-nical analysis from a scientific lense and we fully un-derstand the pitfalls of data mining and subjective pat-tern recognition. At the same time we understand the benefits that technical analysis has, namely allowing one produce a fast opinion based on objective data in-puts related to price and volume. The big problem we attribute to technical analysis is that most people get stuck looking for only a few patterns or indicators as it’s hard to keep track of every possible technical pattern. In addition there is often no scientific analysis used to in-form a user what has historically worked and what hasn’t. Anyone who has ever traded intraday will likely appreciate that many indicators like candle stick for-mations and classic chart patterns work much different-ly on intraday bars vs daily or weekly bars.
What do you see?
For example, take a look at this chart of Estee Lauder (ticker EL) stock from early 2017, shown below. We have overlaid the 50 and 200 day moving average on a daily bar chart, which is a common set up for many stock traders. What do you see? Notice that the 200 day mov-ing average, in yellow seems to work as a good support level in 2013 but afterwards it stops working as price often moves below at times. The 50 day moving average, in green, similarly works as a pivot level most of the time but not so well in 2014-2015.
Now we can also show you the same stock but this time with a 300 day moving average, image below, and you can see that it acts as a much better support line than the 200 day moving average. But if you didn’t plot that on your chat you might have missed it. 

We can also remove all the moving averages and plot a Weekly candle chart to try and view support and re-sistance levels. Did you notice that $75-77 was a major support band in early 2017, generated from previous support and resistance levels? If you had too many mov-ing averages or not enough history in  your chart you might have missed it. 

The really great thing about Pattern Finder is that you can easily add in non-price data as well. In the chart below, we show EL’s Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio bands, in orange and forward EPS in blue. While most retail traders probably don’t have access to this data or don’t use it, almost all institutional investors pay attention to a stock’s P/E ratio and EPS growth trend. It would have been nice to know that in late 2016, when the stock was selling off into the weekly support/resistance level the P/E ratio was at the lower end of the range. But if you didn’t have the data or pay attention to it, how would you have ever known? Pattern Finder puts the power of data and patterns in your hands. We give you the statistics, we show you what matters, allowing you to make better decisions.confirmation signal perhaps, in late 2016 that the P/E ratio was at the lower part of the range even as the forward earning were still in a general uptrend. But if you didn’t have the data or pay attention to it, how would you have ever known? PatternFinder puts the power of data and patterns in your hands. We give you the statistics, we show you what matters, al-lowing you to make better decisions. 

Bot Builder
Nvest is collecting lots of data but it doesn’t do you any good unless you can do something with it. With Bot Builder you can easily access the data and create your own bot to perform an action with it. Your bot can be as simple or as complex as you want it; trigger an email alert if the price of Bitcoin goes above a certain level or go advanced and build your own trading strategy. Bot builder will provide easy to use templates to allow new users to experiment and also tutorials showing how easy it is to create your own bot. Using nvest’s drag and drop user interface, built on top MIT’s wonderfully popular scratch library, bot builder allows you to create your own algorithms with writing any code.
   Bot builder is currently running on nvest.io under the tab “Strategy Builder”. While current functionality is limited to building a trading strategy, nvest will quickly add useful features like email/ sms/ telegram alerts and daily reports in Phase 1 of the project roadmap.

Crypto Sight
As crypto markets have evolved into an entire ecosystem with thousands of projects and hundreds of exchanges, analyzing the entire system can provide insights that can be missed if you aren’t looking holistically. Since nvest is in the business of collecting and analyzing da-ta, we make it easy to analyze the entire crypto market. We leverage established solutions from traditional fi-nancial markets and apply them to crypto markets, all the while understanding the nuances and tailoring the output for crypto.
   Crypto sight will provide users the ability to create their own reports, including daily summaries, crypto scans and statistical insights. Nvest will provide a vari-ety of templates for users to start and allow users to easi-ly build and customize to their own needs.
   For example, a daily report might be generated which can summarize all of the day’s news on a portfolio of crypto currencies and be sent automatically to the user every night. Technical traders can use pre-built scans to find trading opportunities or create their own custom-ized versions. Nvest also provides an extensive library of statistics, which can be easily accessed. For example you can analyze bitcoin price data by day and time of the week to show you when the most and least volatile times of the week to trade are.

Token Discovery
Statistical analysis is good when you have numbers, but what do you do when the data you are dealing with is words and text? Fortunately machine learning has been working on the problem for a while and recent advances in the field of NLP (“Natural Language Processing”) allows for excellent analytical insights on text data.
  NLP encompasses a variety of different applications, from sentiment analysis, speech recognition, automatic summary, topic segmentation, relationship extraction and others (see Wikipedia). A common thread in many NLP tasks is that they require lots of data and they still involve human oversight, particularly related to train-ing data, before the algorithmic models can be created. The good thing is that once an NLP model is loaded with the proper data and settings, you don’t need to be a machine learning expert to be able to use it. Nvest’s team of machine learning experts will provide the nec-essary data and supervision for NLP model creation so that users can easily build on top of our models and deploy their own NLP tools.
   Most NLP tools also allow for a high degree of custom-ization which is often inaccessible unless you are a de-veloper. Nvest believes that each user has their own unique needs and style and we want to provide every-one a unique experience. Creating a sentiment analysis indicator is good but creating one personalized just for you is so much better. Should a day trader and a long term investor use the same sentiment analysis settings? By guiding users through the different setting available and making them easy to adjust, nvest enables each user to maximize their experience.
   Token Discovery tools can be applied to a variety of data sources and can be easily accessed via the nvest API. You can use Token Discovery to analyze a white paper and use the results as an input in your ICO spreadsheet. For example, if there is a particular word or phrase that you are interested with, or conversely, want to avoid, you can easily create your own Token Discov-ery score to scan through hundreds of white papers and report the results. Or you can use pre-built models like a grammar score, word complexity score or even a fraud test as a new data point to include in your ICO analysis. Enhance your ICO spreadsheet with advanced data that is processed in seconds and always up to date with To-ken Discovery.

Opnionator
Detailed analysis performed by a specialist can often yield valuable information and insights that a non-specialist would never see. Nvest provides a platform for crypto experts to present their analysis and in return earn nvest token rewards. While many investors and traders publish their views and analysis it’s hard to distinguish who the experts are and what their opin-ions are worth.

With Opinionator, nvest creates a market for both con-sumers and publishers of research. It allows anyone to publish their analysis with a variety of settings (pub-lic/private) and simplifies payments.
   Using nvest tokens as rewards, Opinionatior is ideal for new research analysts and provides them reach to the entire nvest community of users. If a given research analyst is able to provide a different angle of insight to what is generally available (ie most of the research on topic is related to technical analysis and then a cryptog-rapher offers a totally different view) then their input should be highly valued and incentivized. Given that higher quality research should demand higher prices, consumers can also view how many nvest tokens a user has earned as an extra input when searching for re-search, similar to searching for high gross blog posts on Steemit.

Porfolio-Rizer
Successful investing often involves managing a portfo-lio of investments and for traders managing multiple positions at the same time. Porfoliorizer gives you the tools, specifically tailored to crypto markets so that you can analyze your entire portfolio. You can view attribu-tion reports to show you where you made and lost mon-ey, monitor where your portfolio volatility of coming from, see how correlated your holdings are, create stress tests, goal settings and more. Leveraging traditional fi-nancial portfolio theories and tools, nvest’s Porfoliorizer tools will also be tailored to crypto markets, which has price volatility and skew unlike traditional assets of stocks and bonds and is more akin venture capital in-vestments. This means that existing portfolio manage-ment tools built for the stock market may need to be modified in certain instances. Given that many modern portfolio management theories and applications require a strong mathematic knowledge alongside practical un-derstanding of how markets work. But nvest's expert team will ensure any portfolio tools we release will be theoretically and practically adapted to crypto so you don’t have to worry.
   Crypto portfolio analytics are often neglected or diffi-cult to use but with nvest we make it easy and intuitive allowing you to analyze your entire portfolio and pro-vide you a richer set of insights that you could get from just analyzing an individual crypto on its own. As cryp-to markets mature, many crypto investors will realize that managing their portfolio will be just as important as managing the next trade.
